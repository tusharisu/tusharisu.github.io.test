I make the data talkâ€¦ or vice versa! 

I am a detail-oriented, responsible, and dedicated data professional with a "get-it-done" attitude and a passion for delivering high-quality results. My problem-solving skills are paired with a customer-centric approach, empowering organizations to innovate and make data-driven decisions. I excel in working within agile/scrum project management frameworks, enabling teams to deliver value to their customers with efficiency.

My true joy lies in training both technical and non-technical users, while also crafting efficient and modern database solutions. My focus extends beyond just accuracy and precision; I actively seek opportunities for automation.

One of the projects that kickstarted my professional journey and shaped my expertise is Data Segmentation, a field I am deeply passionate about. I leverage this skill every day to drive successful business and data projects.

I have a genuine love for discussing and presenting on topics related to data. To date, I have had the privilege of delivering guest lectures at Iowa State University on Organizational Behavior, Project Management, Data Segmentation, Data Migration, and Agile Methodology. I have also been featured as a podcast guest on Alma Matters.
